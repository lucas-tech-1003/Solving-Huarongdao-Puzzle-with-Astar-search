# Input

The puzzle board is four spaces wide and five spaces tall. We will consider the variants of this puzzle with ten pieces. There are four kinds of pieces:

One 2x2 piece.
Five 1x2 pieces. Each 1x2 piece is either placed horizontally or vertically. 
Four 1x1 pieces.
Once we place the ten pieces on the board, two empty spaces should remain.
